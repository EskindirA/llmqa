# Building an AI-Powered Document Q&A System: A Journey from Concept to Deployment

*How we built a document upload and question-answering system using modern web technologies, and what we learned along the way.*

---

## üéØ The Vision

In today's information-rich world, we often find ourselves drowning in documents - PDFs, Word files, research papers, and reports. The ability to quickly extract insights and answer specific questions from these documents has become increasingly valuable. This project was born from a simple question: *"What if we could build a system that lets users upload documents and ask questions about their content?"*

Our goal was to create a **document Q&A system** that could:
- Accept various document formats (PDF, Word, text)
- Extract and process text content
- Allow users to ask questions in natural language
- Provide relevant answers with source references
- Offer a modern, intuitive user interface

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### The Stack We Chose

We decided to build a **full-stack web application** with the following components:

**Frontend:**
- **React** - For the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS** - For rapid, responsive styling
- **Framer Motion** - For smooth animations and transitions
- **React Dropzone** - For drag-and-drop file uploads

**Backend:**
- **Node.js + Express** - For the API server
- **Supabase** - For document storage and database
- **Multer** - For handling file uploads
- **pdf-parse & mammoth** - For document text extraction

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend and backend
2. **Scalable Storage**: Using Supabase for persistent document storage
3. **Modern UI/UX**: Focus on user experience with smooth interactions
4. **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new features and integrations

## üöÄ Development Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

We started by setting up the basic project structure:

```bash
llmqa/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # React frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Node.js backend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json     # Root configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # Documentation
```

The initial setup involved:
- Creating the React application with modern tooling
- Setting up the Express server with proper middleware
- Configuring Tailwind CSS for styling
- Setting up development scripts for concurrent frontend/backend development

### Phase 2: Document Processing Pipeline

One of the core challenges was handling different document formats. We implemented a **document processing pipeline**:

```javascript
// Document processing flow
Upload ‚Üí Extract Text ‚Üí Generate Summary ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Index for Search
```

**Text Extraction Challenges:**
- **PDFs**: Some PDFs had parsing issues ("bad XRef entry" errors)
- **Word Documents**: Successfully handled using mammoth library
- **Text Files**: Straightforward processing

**Solution**: We implemented fallback mechanisms and clear error handling to gracefully handle problematic files.

### Phase 3: Storage and Search

Initially, we planned to use **vector embeddings** for semantic search, but we encountered compatibility issues with the embedding libraries. Instead, we implemented a **text-based similarity search**:

```javascript
// Simple word overlap similarity
calculateSimilarity(text1, text2) {
  const words1 = text1.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);
  const words2 = text2.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);
  const intersection = words1.filter(word => words2.includes(word));
  const union = [...new Set([...words1, ...words2])];
  return intersection.length / union.length;
}
```

**Why This Approach:**
- **No External Dependencies**: Works without requiring API keys or large models
- **Fast Performance**: Simple computation, no network calls
- **Predictable Results**: Easy to understand and debug
- **Foundation for Improvement**: Can be enhanced with better algorithms later

### Phase 4: User Interface Development

We focused on creating an **intuitive, modern interface** with three main sections:

1. **Document Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with file validation
2. **Document Management**: List view with summaries and delete functionality
3. **Question & Answer**: Chat-like interface for asking questions

**UI/UX Highlights:**
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion for engaging interactions
- **Clear Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing

The most challenging part was **integrating all components**:

**Supabase Integration:**
- Setting up the database schema
- Configuring proper environment variables
- Handling connection issues and error states

**API Development:**
- RESTful endpoints for upload, search, and document management
- Proper error handling and validation
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication

## üîß Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Supabase URL Configuration

**Problem**: Initially, we used the wrong Supabase URL format, pointing to the dashboard instead of the API endpoint.

**Solution**: 
```env
# Wrong
SUPABASE_URL=https://supabase.com/project/your-project-id

# Correct
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
```

### Challenge 2: Search Quality

**Problem**: The simple word overlap similarity wasn't finding relevant results for natural language queries.

**Solution**: We removed the similarity threshold filter and always return the top N most similar documents, ensuring users always get some response.

### Challenge 3: File Upload Field Names

**Problem**: Frontend was sending files with field name `file`, but backend expected `document`.

**Solution**: Standardized on `document` as the field name and updated both frontend and backend accordingly.

### Challenge 4: Port Conflicts

**Problem**: Default port 5000 was already in use by AirTunes on macOS.

**Solution**: Switched to port 3001 for the backend API.

## üìä Current System Capabilities

### What Works Well

‚úÖ **Document Upload**: Supports PDF, Word, and text files  
‚úÖ **Text Extraction**: Reliable extraction from most document types  
‚úÖ **Document Storage**: Persistent storage in Supabase
